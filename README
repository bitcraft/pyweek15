PyWeek #15 Entry

Ideas for game:

	Metroidvania adventure.

	I'm reusing portions of my last entry for pyweek:
	https://github.com/bitcraft/pyweek14



Story:
    you've been dispatched to mars to investigate a deadly disease outbreak
    on the colony there.

    when you arrive, you are informed of a strange object found nearby and
    you are sent outside the colony to investigate it.

    when it is found, you realize that it is a door and you step through it.

    inside is a small city, covered with rust.  it is protected by a giant
    metallic plate and you realize that the martian surface around the base
    is simply sitting on top of the plate.

    you investigate the ruins and uncover secrets behind it



Goals:

    the game will have three possible endings:

        1. you die and the secret is lost
        2. you go as far as you can, but never can figure out what it is
        3. you uncover evidence that [ spoiler censored! ]


Mechanics:

    the game will feature realistic physics (pure python) and low gravity
    the player can collect a jetpack, gun, and atmosphere generator
    portions of the ancient city can be activated to open new rooms
    focus will be on level design and controlling your player in awkward gravity
    the player can collect relics from the city


possible enemies:

    robots are placed throughout the rooms and may be activated and will
    attempt to destroy the player.

    traps such as rusted floors and broken stairs may kill the player.

    running and shooting may become an option with a item found 3/4 of the way
    through the game.
